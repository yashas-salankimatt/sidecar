# Agents: Mandatory: use td usage --new-session to see open work

If you don't have an existing task for the work you're about to start, create one first.

## Build & Versioning

```bash
# Build
go build ./...

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Install with version (use semantic versioning)
go install -ldflags "-X main.Version=v0.1.0" ./cmd/sidecar

# Tag a release
git tag v0.1.0 -m "Release message"
TEMPORARY CHANGE FOR THE LULZ
```

Version is set via ldflags at build time. Without it, sidecar shows git revision info.

## Keyboard Shortcut Parity

Maintain consistent keybindings across plugins for familiar UX:

**Navigation shortcuts that should work in all scrollable views:**

- `j`/`down` - scroll down (1 line)
- `k`/`up` - scroll up (1 line)
- `ctrl+d` - page down (~10 lines) [file browser ✓, git diff ✗]
- `ctrl+u` - page up (~10 lines) [file browser ✓, git diff ✗]
- `g` - go to top [file browser ✓, git diff ✓]
- `G` - go to bottom [file browser ✓, git diff ✓]

See td-331dbf19 for diff paging implementation.

## Plugin View Rendering

**Critical: Always constrain plugin output height.** The app's header/footer are always visible - plugins must not exceed their allocated height or the header will scroll off-screen.

In `View(width, height int)`:

1. Store dimensions: `p.width, p.height = width, height`
2. Calculate internal layout respecting `height` (e.g., `contentHeight := height - headerLines - footerLines`)
3. Either use `lipgloss.Height(height).Render(content)` to enforce height, or manually limit rendered lines
4. Never rely on the app to truncate - it wraps with Height() but edge cases cause rendering bugs

This bug manifests as "top bar disappears" after state transitions (commits, refreshes, mode switches).

## Footer Hints

**Do NOT render footers in plugin View().** The app renders a unified footer bar using `plugin.Commands()` and keymap bindings. Plugins should:

1. Define commands with short names in `Commands()` method
2. Never render their own footer/hint line - this creates duplicate footers

Keep command names short (1 word preferred) to prevent footer wrapping:

- "Stage" not "Stage file"
- "Diff" not "Show diff"
- "History" not "Show history"

The footer auto-truncates hints that exceed available width.

## Inter-Plugin Communication

Plugins communicate via tea.Msg broadcast - all plugins receive all messages.

**App-level messages** (`internal/app/commands.go`):

- `FocusPluginByIDMsg{PluginID}` - switch focus to a plugin by ID
- `app.FocusPlugin(id)` - helper to create the above

**File browser messages** (`internal/plugins/filebrowser/plugin.go`):

- `NavigateToFileMsg{Path}` - navigate to and preview a file (relative path)

**Usage pattern** (e.g., git → file browser):

```go
func (p *Plugin) openInFileBrowser(path string) tea.Cmd {
    return tea.Batch(
        app.FocusPlugin("file-browser"),
        func() tea.Msg { return filebrowser.NavigateToFileMsg{Path: path} },
    )
}
```
