# Sidecar

You might never open your editor again.

**Status: Beta** - Generally working for most use cases.

[Documentation](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/) · [Getting Started](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/intro)

![Git Status](docs/screenshots/sidecar-git.png)

## Overview

AI agents write your code. Sidecar gives you the rest of the development workflow: plan tasks with [td](https://github.com/marcus/td), review diffs, stage commits, and manage git worktrees—all without opening an editor.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcus/sidecar/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
```

Or see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for manual installation.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- macOS, Linux, or WSL

## Quick Start

After installation, run from any project directory:

```bash
sidecar
```

## Suggested Use

Split your terminal horizontally: run your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) on the left and sidecar on the right.

```
┌─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│                             │                     │
│   Claude Code / Cursor      │      Sidecar        │
│                             │                     │
│   $ claude                  │   [Git] [Files]     │
│   > fix the auth bug...     │   [Tasks] [Worktrees]│
│                             │                     │
└─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

As the agent works, you can:

- Watch tasks move through the workflow in TD Monitor
- See files change in real-time in the Git plugin
- Browse and edit code yourself in the File Browser
- View and resume conversations across all supported agent adapters

This setup gives you visibility into what the agent is doing without interrupting your workflow. The entire dev loop—planning, monitoring, reviewing, committing—happens in the terminal while agents write the code.

## Usage

```bash
# Run from any project directory
sidecar

# Specify project root
sidecar --project /path/to/project

# Enable debug logging
sidecar --debug

# Check version
sidecar --version
```

## Updates

Sidecar checks for updates on startup. When a new version is available, a toast notification appears. Press `!` to open the diagnostics modal and see the update command.

## Plugins

### Git Status

View staged, modified, and untracked files with a split-pane interface. The sidebar shows files and recent commits; the main pane shows syntax-highlighted diffs. [Full documentation →](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/git-plugin)

![Git Status with Diff](docs/screenshots/sidecar-git.png)

**Features:**

- Stage/unstage files with `s`/`u`
- View diffs inline or full-screen with `d`
- Toggle side-by-side diff view with `v`
- Browse commit history and view commit diffs
- Auto-refresh on file system changes

### Conversations

Browse session history from multiple AI coding agents with message content, token usage, and search. Supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Warp. [Full documentation →](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/conversations-plugin)

![Conversations](docs/screenshots/sidecar-conversations.png)

**Features:**

- Unified view across all supported agents
- View all sessions grouped by date
- Search sessions with `/`
- Expand messages to see full content
- Track token usage per session

### TD Monitor

Integration with [TD](https://github.com/marcus/td), a task management system designed for AI agents working across context windows. TD helps agents track work, log progress, and maintain context across sessions—essential for AI-assisted development where context windows reset between conversations. [Full documentation →](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/td)

![TD Monitor](docs/screenshots/sidecar-td.png)

**Features:**

- Current focused task display
- Scrollable task list with status indicators
- Activity log with session context
- Quick review submission with `r`

See the [TD repository](https://github.com/marcus/td) for installation and CLI usage.

### File Browser

Navigate project files with a tree view and syntax-highlighted preview. [Full documentation →](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/files-plugin)

![File Browser](docs/screenshots/sidecar-files.png)

**Features:**

- Collapsible directory tree
- Code preview with syntax highlighting
- Auto-refresh on file changes

### Worktrees

Manage git worktrees for parallel development with integrated agent support. Create isolated branches as sibling directories, link tasks from TD, and launch coding agents directly from sidecar. [Full documentation →](https://marcus.github.io/sidecar/docs/worktrees-plugin)

![Worktrees](docs/screenshots/sidecar-worktrees.png)

**Features:**

- Create and delete git worktrees with `n`/`D`
- Link TD tasks to worktrees for context tracking
- Launch Claude Code, Cursor, or OpenRouter agents with `a`
- Merge workflow: commit, push, create PR, and cleanup with `m`
- Auto-adds sidecar state files to .gitignore
- Preview diffs and task details in split-pane view
