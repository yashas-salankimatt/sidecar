## Overview

The Conversations plugin provides a two-pane layout:

- **Draggable divider**: Resize panes to your preference

Toggle the sidebar with `\` to maximize message space.

## Message View

Two view modes for reading conversations:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `l` or `r` | Toggle between flow and turn view |

### Conversation Flow

Messages display in order, similar to chat-style interfaces:
- User messages with prompts
- Assistant responses with tool results collapsed
- Expandable tool invocations

### Turn View

Groups messages into conversation "turns" (user prompt + assistant response):
- Collapsed by default
- Shows token counts and tool summary
- Expand to see full message content

## Message Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j`, `↓` | Next turn/message |
| `k`, `↑` | Previous turn/message |
| `enter` or `d` | Expand/collapse turn or view detail |
| `y` | Copy turn content |
| `o` | Open in CLI |

### Detail View

Press `enter` on a turn to see full details in the right pane:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j`, `↓` | Scroll down |
| `k`, `↑` | Scroll up |
| `ctrl+d` | Page down |
| `ctrl+u` | Page up |
| `y` | Copy detail content |
| `h`, `←` | Return to turn list |
| `esc` | Close detail view |

## Pane Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `tab` | Switch to next pane |
| `shift+tab` | Switch to previous pane |
| `l`, `→` | Focus message pane |
| `h`, `←` | Focus sidebar |
| `\` | Toggle sidebar visibility |

## Session Analytics

View statistics about a session:
- Model usage breakdown (tokens by model)
- File impacts (which files were created/modified)
- Tool invocations (count by tool type)
- Total token consumption

## Pagination

Sessions load 50 messages at a time. Scroll to load older messages automatically with "load older" support for long conversations.

## Incremental Updates

The plugin watches for new messages and coalesces updates for performance. Your session list stays current as agents work.

## Render Caching

Markdown rendering is cached per-message to maintain smooth scrolling even with large conversations.

## Mouse Support

- **Click session**: Select and view
- **Click turn**: Expand/collapse
- **Click tool**: Toggle tool result visibility
- **Drag divider**: Resize panes
- **Scroll**: Navigate lists and content

## State Persistence

These preferences save across sessions:

- Expanded states
