# Git Plugin

A full-featured git interface for staging, diffing, committing, and managing branches—all without leaving your terminal. Watch your agent's changes in real-time with side-by-side diffs and inline previews.

![Git Status](../../docs/screenshots/sidecar-git.png)

## Overview

The Git plugin provides a three-pane layout:

- **Left pane**: File tree (staged, modified, untracked) + recent commits
- **Right pane**: Diff preview or commit details
- **Draggable divider**: Resize panes to your preference

Changes auto-refresh as your agent works, so you always see the current state.

## File Status

Files are organized into sections with status indicators:

| Symbol | Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `M` | Modified | File changed |
| `A` | Added | New file (staged) |
| `D` | Deleted | File removed |
| `R` | Renamed | File renamed |
| `?` | Untracked | New file not tracked |
| `U` | Unmerged | Merge conflict |

Each file shows `+/-` line counts for quick impact assessment.

## Staging & Unstaging

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Stage selected file or folder |
| `u` | Unstage selected file |
| `S` | Stage all files |
| `D` | Discard changes (with confirmation) |

Stage entire folders by selecting the folder and pressing `s`. After staging, the cursor automatically moves to the next unstaged file.

## Diff Viewing

View changes inline or in full-screen mode with syntax highlighting.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `d` | Open full-screen diff |
| `v` | Toggle unified / side-by-side view |
| `h/l` | Scroll horizontally (wide diffs) |
| `0` | Reset horizontal scroll |
| `esc`, `q` | Close diff |

### Diff Modes

- **Unified**: Traditional line-by-line format with `+` and `-` markers
- **Side-by-side**: Split view showing before/after columns

Your preferred mode persists across sessions.

### Diff Sources

- **Modified files**: Working directory changes (`git diff`)
- **Staged files**: Changes ready to commit (`git diff --cached`)
- **Untracked files**: Shows all lines as additions
- **Commits**: View what changed in any commit

## Commit Workflow

1. Stage files with `s` or `S`
2. Press `c` to open the commit modal
3. Enter your commit message (multi-line supported)
4. Press `ctrl+s` or Tab to button and Enter

The modal shows:
- Count of staged files
- Total lines added/removed
- List of files being committed
- Message textarea

If commit fails (hooks, etc.), your message is preserved for retry.

## Branch Management

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `b` | Open branch picker |

The branch picker shows:
- All local branches
- Current branch highlighted
- Upstream tracking info (`↑N ↓N` ahead/behind)

Select a branch and press Enter to switch.

## Push, Pull & Fetch

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `P` | Open push menu |
| `p` | Pull from remote |
| `f` | Fetch from remote |

### Push Menu

Three options when you press `P`:

1. **Push**: Regular `git push -u origin HEAD`
2. **Force push**: `git push --force-with-lease` (safer force push)
3. **Push with upstream**: Sets tracking if not configured

Quick shortcuts in the push menu:
- `p` - Quick push
- `f` - Quick force push
- `u` - Quick push with upstream

### Push Status

The commit sidebar shows:
- Commits ahead/behind upstream
- Per-commit pushed indicator
- Unpushed commit count

## Stash Operations

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `z` | Stash all changes |
| `Z` | Pop latest stash (with confirmation) |

Pop shows a confirmation modal with stash details before applying.

### Commit Search

Search by commit subject or author name. Supports:

### Commit Graph

Press `v` to toggle ASCII graph visualization showing branch history:

```

```

### Commit Preview

Select a commit to see:

## Clipboard Operations
